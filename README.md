## Features

### Users

- Sign up/in with google.
- Can be seen as online/offline by their directs.
- Obviously send messages and react to them.

### Channels

- Can make them by addding currently online users.

### Directs

- Can establish a new direct with a currently online user.

## TODOS

1. Notifications system for unread messages.
2. Add message pinning, favoriting, forwarding.
3. Threads (basically replies).
4. Being able to CRUD messages/channels with edit history.
5. Make info tab for channels to show online users, etc...
6. Video previews, gifs, images.
7. Refactor websocket file.
8. Add reverse infinite loading (this is tougher than it seems).
9. Implement user search when creating channel/direct & also add pagination to online users.
